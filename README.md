# CVE ID
CVE-2024-30735

# Title
Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in ROS Kinetic Kame

# Vulnerability Type
Insufficient File Upload Validation

# Severity
TBD

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS Kinetic Kame (ROS_VERSION=1 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been discovered in ROS Kinetic Kame. This vulnerability lies within the file upload mechanism of the ROS system, including the serverâ€™s functionality for handling file uploads and the associated validation processes. This flaw allows attackers to upload malicious files, leading to various security threats.

# Impact
Code Execution: True; 
Denial of Service: True; 
Information Disclosure: True; 
Other: System and Data Compromise, Spread of Malware, Data Breaches, Operational Disruption.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability can be exploited through direct file uploads, bypassing validation checks, and exploiting insecure network transmissions.

# Solution
ROS users should immediately update their system to a version that rectifies this vulnerability. It's crucial to enhance the file upload validation process to prevent the upload of malicious files.

# Workaround
In the absence of an immediate update, users should manually enforce stringent file upload controls, including file type restrictions and size limitations. Monitoring network transmissions for signs of insecurity or unusual activity is also recommended.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
